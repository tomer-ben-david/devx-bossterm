# Release Notes - v1.0.25

**Release Date:** 2025-12-10

## Highlights
This release introduces inline image support (iTerm2-style imgcat), custom title bar improvements with macOS traffic light integration, and several critical fixes for cursor positioning and terminal resizing behavior.

## New Features
- **Inline Image Support**: Implemented OSC 1337;File protocol for displaying images inline (iTerm2 imgcat compatible)
- **Multipart File Protocol**: Support for multipart file transfers in OSC sequences
- **Configurable Login Session**: Added setting for login session to control "Last login" message display on macOS
- **Enhanced Window Background**: New BlurEffect API for macOS-style frosted glass window background with improved traffic light button rendering

## Bug Fixes
- **Cursor Positioning**: Fixed cursor staying at buffer position when scrolling through history
- **Terminal Resize**: Keep cursor in view when terminal shrinks, preventing extra prompts on resize
- **Image Display**: Fixed scroll behavior after inline image display and reduced blank spaces around images
- **Screen Clear**: Images now properly clear when screen is cleared (ED 2/3 sequences)
- **Image Rendering**: Fixed blank line creation below inline images and improved rendering to respect full image height regardless of cursor position

## Improvements
- **OSC Sequence Limit**: Increased buffer size to support large inline images
- **Background Blur**: Refined blur effect implementation using reactive composition and proper graphicsLayer integration
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed debug logging from IncrementalSnapshotBuilder and image rendering
- **Legacy Code Removal**: Removed legacy image placement fallback rendering code

## Breaking Changes
