# Release Notes - v1.0.42

**Release Date:** 2025-12-19

## Highlights
This release introduces automatic startup commands, version management improvements, and several critical bug fixes for ProGuard compatibility, shell readiness detection, and UI interactions.

## New Features
- **Initial Command Setting**: Added `initialCommand` setting to automatically execute commands when terminal starts (e.g., automatically run scripts on startup)
- **Version Selector**: Added version selector in About section for easy upgrade/downgrade between BossTerm versions

## Bug Fixes
- **ProGuard Compatibility**: Fixed ClassCastException by replacing EnumSet with MutableSet to prevent ProGuard optimization issues
- **Shell Readiness Detection**: Replaced fixed 500ms delay with OSC 133;A detection for more reliable shell initialization
- **Mouse Event Focus**: Fixed focus handling to ensure split panes receive focus before forwarding mouse events to TUI apps
- **Menu Split Actions**: Fixed split actions not working due to LaunchedEffect timing issues

## Improvements
- **ProGuard Configuration**: Added ProGuard rules for release builds to enable code optimization and obfuscation
- **Settings UI**: Made settings side menu scrollable for better usability with long settings lists
- **Documentation**: Added "applies to new tabs" note to initial command settings for clarity
