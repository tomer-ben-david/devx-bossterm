# Release Notes - v1.0.46

**Release Date:** 2025-12-23

## Highlights
This release significantly improves emoji and Unicode character rendering, with a focus on flag emoji support (Regional Indicator sequences), grapheme-aware selection, and character width classification accuracy.

## New Features
- **Flag Emoji Support**: Added full support for flag emoji using Regional Indicator sequences (🇺🇸, 🇬🇧, 🇯🇵, etc.)
- **Grapheme-Aware Selection**: Selection rendering now properly handles complex emoji sequences including ZWJ sequences and combining characters
- **Unicode Constants Extraction**: Created shared `UnicodeConstants.kt` for consistent Unicode handling across the codebase
- **Enhanced EmbeddableTerminal**: Added `initialCommand` parameter to allow specifying a command to run on terminal startup

## Bug Fixes
- **Regional Indicator Bounds**: Fixed index out of bounds error when handling Regional Indicator sequences at buffer boundaries
- **Emoji Classification**: Fixed emoji classification to match between buffer and renderer, preventing rendering glitches
- **Media Control Symbols**: Removed incorrectly classified media control symbols (⏸, ⏵) from 2-cell emoji list
- **Emoji Background Alignment**: Fixed emoji background rendering to properly align with text positioning
- **Gender Symbol ZWJ**: Fixed Zero-Width Joiner check for gender symbols in emoji sequences

## Improvements
- **Performance**: Added character analysis caching to avoid redundant computation during rendering
- **Code Quality**: Extensive refactoring to deduplicate emoji classification logic and skip logic in `renderBackgrounds()`
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive KDoc for character analysis edge cases and width properties
- **Documentation**: Added Linux and JAR installation instructions
- **Workflow Enhancements**: Added options to skip snap builds and enable publish-only mode
- **Troubleshooting**: Added guide for focus management issues
